\chapter{Future Prospects: SKALA Radio Antennas at Auger}\label{chap:skala}
The Pierre Auger Observatory hosts several prototype detectors and pathfinder air-shower arrays in addition to the detectors discussed in~\cref{chap:cosmicrays}.
This location greatly benefits prototyping new detectors because of the existing structure of the Auger observatory, allowing ease of access for detector maintenance and assistance from the local observatory staff when feasible.
Since 2022, 21 total SKALA (Square Kilometer Array Log-periodic Antenna) radio antennas have been deployed at Auger in the \SI{433}{\meter} spaced array of SD tanks.
These SKALA antennas are Log-Periodic Dipole Antennas (LPDAs), similar to the AERA LPDA antennas, and were originally designed for the Square Kilometer Array's low frequency telescope in Western Australia.
However, certain future cosmic-ray observatories with a surface radio component, such as IceCube-Gen2 and the Radio Neutrino Observatory Greenland (RNO-G), use SKALA antennas to reconstruct and/or veto cosmic ray air showers.
This chapter discusses deployment, hardware specifications, and preliminary analysis from SKALA antennas deployed at the Pierre Auger Observatory.

%Combining electromagnetic and hadronic air-shower components is now moving into a new era of instrumentation based on current and upcoming air-shower observatories. The Square Kilometer Array (SKA) is a planned radio astronomy observatory located in Australia. It will include a dense array of radio antennas... \textbf{include more specifics here after reading papers}. One type of antenna planned to use in its construction is the Square Kilometer Array Log-periodic Antenna (SKALA) 


\section{An IceCube-Gen2 Prototype Station at the Pierre Auger Observatory}\label{sec:gen2prototype}

IceCube-Gen2 is a future upgrade of the existing IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole.
The upgrade plans to increase the volume of the current in-ice optical array from \SI{1}{\kilo\meter^{3}} to approximately \SI{8}{\kilo\meter^{3}}, in addition to deploying an in-ice radio array for neutrino detection and a surface array of scintillator panels and radio antennas for cosmic ray air shower detection.
The surface array will cover the full \SI{8}{\kilo\meter^{2}} surface area of the optical array extension, serving both as a veto to the optical array and to reconstruct cosmic ray air showers and their properties.
