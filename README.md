# Ben's PhD Thesis
A repository to track the process of my PhD thesis

Hopefully this will keep me accountable with writing :)

## Notes

Doctoral dissertations at the University of Delaware must follow a structure outlined online by the university [here](https://services.udel.edu/TDClient/32/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=324).

The file `udthesis.cls` follows this structure and was downloaded from the link above.

The example files (all the `.tex` and `.bib` files as of August 11, 2025) were also downloaded from this link.

The file `dissertation-main.pdf` was made locally using pdflatex version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.22
