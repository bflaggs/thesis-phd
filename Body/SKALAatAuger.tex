\chapter{Future Prospects: SKALA Radio Antennas at Auger}\label{chap:skala}
The Pierre Auger Observatory hosts several prototype detectors and pathfinder air-shower arrays in addition to the detectors discussed in~\Cref{chap:auger}.
This location greatly benefits prototyping new detectors because of the existing structure of the Auger observatory, allowing ease of access for detector maintenance and assistance from the local observatory staff when feasible.
Recently, several stations for radio detection of cosmic-ray air showers using Square Kilometer Array Log-periodic Antenna (SKALA) radio antennas have been deployed at Auger.
These SKALA antennas are Log-Periodic Dipole Antennas (LPDAs), similar to the AERA LPDA antennas, and were originally designed for the Square Kilometer Array's (SKA) low frequency telescope in Western Australia.
However, future cosmic-ray observatories with a surface radio component, such as IceCube-Gen2 and the Radio Neutrino Observatory Greenland (RNO-G), plan to use SKALA antennas to reconstruct and/or veto cosmic ray air showers.
This chapter discusses deployment, hardware specifications, and preliminary analysis from SKALA antennas deployed at the Pierre Auger Observatory.

    \label{fig:auger_map_skala_inset}
\end{figure}

Since 2022, 21 total SKALA-v2 radio antennas have been deployed at Auger in the \SI{433}{\meter} spaced array of SD tanks.
\Cref{fig:auger_map_skala_inset} shows a map of all 21 SKALA antennas deployed in this region of the Auger array, inset against the full Auger array of SD tanks.
A single station for the SKALA detector system is formed by a group of three antennas arranged in a Mercedes-Benz like three-pointed star hence, in total, the 21 SKALA antennas at Auger constitute seven total stations.
One station forms the IceCube-Gen2 prototype station at Auger, while the other six stations form the Auger Radio Infill SKALA Extension (ARISE) array.
In~\Cref{fig:auger_map_skala_inset}, the IceCube-Gen2 prototype station is composed of the three SKALA antennas to the Northeast of the Auger Central Radio Station (CRS), shown as the orange star on the map, while the 18 SKALA antennas surrounding the Auger SD to the Northwest of the CRS form the six stations of ARISE. 
Stations for ARISE differ slightly from the IceCube-Gen2 prototype station, where these differences are described in more detail in the coming sections, one section each for the prototype station and ARISE.
This section serves to describe the similarities of the SKALA detector systems, specifically describing the hardware, data acquisition system (DAQ), and the data transfer and storage.

The backbone of all SKALA detector systems at Auger is housed inside the CRS, of which the main components are a laptop and a White Rabbit (WR) switch.
The laptop is a Panasonic FZ-55 toughbook, chosen for its fanless design and ability to withstand dust and other harsh environments.
It is used for directly interfacing with the SKALA detector systems, including the starting and stopping of data taking, storage and logging of data, and transfer of the data via Wi-Fi.
The nearby Coihueco FD site provides Wi-Fi at the CRS yet is limited to a \SI{40}{Mbps} speed, with the total data volume for the SKALA detector systems capped at \SI{10}{Mbps}.
This Wi-Fi connection is made possible from two Ubiquiti Bullet bidirectional radio transceivers pointed towards Coihueco.
One Ubiquiti bullet link is used solely for AERA, while the second, originally a backup for AERA, is used to power a network switch inside the CRS to provide internet access for all devices connected to the switch, including the FZ-55 toughbook.
Other devices connected to the network switch include the Grand@Auger computer, and a Wi-Fi router, powered by a DC-AC inverter, to provide internet access for those performing field work inside the CRS.

The WR switch, shown in~\Cref{fig:wr_switch}, is a specialized network switch designed to provide precise synchronization between multiple detectors by distributing a master time signal with sub-nanosecond timing accuracy amongst all connected components.
The switch has 18 SFP ports, used for distribution of the master timing signal and communications to all connected devices, a management port, for configuring and monitoring the WR switch, and SMC connections for both input and output PPS and \SI{10}{\mega\hertz} timing signals.
A GPS antenna, located on the roof of the CRS, connects to a GPS clock and level shifter system to provide the PPS and \SI{10}{\mega\hertz} input signals to the WR switch and is used as the master timing signal for the system.
For the SKALA detector system, the WR switch not only controls the timing, but also the communications and data transfer for each station.
To this end, the WR switch connects via ethernet cables to the FZ-55 toughbook in two locations: 1. from the WR switch management port, and 2. from SFP port 17, converted for an ethernet cable connection with an SFP to RJ45 transceiver module.
The FZ-55 controls the settings configuration of the WR switch and timing selection from the management port, as well as provides a monitoring interface and SSH access to the switch.
Timing information of the WR switch network is transferred to the FZ-55 laptop from the connection to SFP port 17.
The laptop internal time is synchronized to the Auger Network Time Protocol (NTP) server, therefore comparisons between the Auger array timing and the internal WR network timing can be performed.
Yet this comparison is limited in accuracy to $\mathcal{O}$(\SI{1}{\milli\second}) due to the accuracy of NTP servers from a local network connection.

%The FZ-55 controls the network settings of the WR switch from the management port using a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server configured on the laptop.
%The configured NTP server should, in principle, be synchronized with the Auger NTP server to within a few milliseconds.
%General settings of the WR switch are also accessible through the management port and controlled from a graphical user interface on the laptop.

\begin{figure}

    \caption[Picture of a White Rabbit switch.]{A picture of the White Rabbit (WR) switch deployed inside the CRS. The RJ45 port labeled "MANAGEMENT" is the WR management port. Directly next to the management port are two SMC male connectors to take the PPS and \SI{10}{\mega\hertz} in signals from the GPS clock defining the master time signal of the WR system. The 18 SFP ports are used for device communication and providing sub-nanosecond synchronization to any connected components. SFP port 17 forms the communication link between the FZ-55 toughbook and all other devices connected to the WR switch.}
    \label{fig:wr_switch}
\end{figure}

Connection to WR switch port 17 also forms the communications channel between the WR switch and FZ-55 toughbook.
From the communications channel, all additional detectors connected to the WR switch can be accessed by the laptop and data can be transferred from these additional detectors directly to the FZ-55 toughbook.
The additional detectors constitute all seven of the SKALA stations deployed at Auger.
Buried military grade optical fibers connect the WR switch to White Rabbit Line Extension (WR-LEN) boards at each SKALA station, where the WR-LEN boards serve as remote access points to the WR switch in the CRS.
The WR-LEN boards connect directly to the station DAQ electronics and control the timing, communications, and data transfer for the station.
This information is all sent bidirectionally through the buried optical fiber to the WR switch, and can then be accessed from the FZ-55 toughbook via WR switch port 17.
Data from each SKALA station is stored at the laptop on one of three SSDs, creatively named \texttt{taxissd\_1}, \texttt{taxissd\_2}, and \texttt{taxissd\_3}.
\texttt{taxissd\_1} is a \SI{2}{\tera\byte} SSD tasked with storing only data for the IceCube-Gen2 prototype station, whereas \texttt{taxissd\_2} and \texttt{taxissd\_3} are both \SI{8}{\tera\byte} SSDs, of SanDisk and Samsung brands respectively, to store data for the ARISE stations.
Each of the SSDs is rated to withstand dust accumulation and all are powered by USB ports of the FZ-55 toughbook.

Two USB hubs are connected to the FZ-55 laptop due to the amount of connections necessary for networking and data taking of the SKALA stations.
One USB hub has ports for both USB-A and ethernet connections, therefore this hub hosts \texttt{taxissd\_1}, the ethernet connection to the WR management port, and a mechanical mouse for field work involving the laptop.
The second USB hub is externally powered from \SI{12}{\volt} DC power of battery bank 1 of the CRS and hosts \texttt{taxissd\_2}, and provides power to the GPS clock and level shifter.
Putting the second USB hub on external power removes some of the power strain placed on the laptop by the connections requiring power over USB.
Power for both the FZ-55 toughbook and the WR switch are provided by \SI{12}{\volt} DC power outputs of battery bank 1 of the CRS.
The \SI{12}{\volt} power line of battery bank 1 reserved for the toughbook is connected to a Lind electronics DC-DC auto power adapter and used to convert the \SI{12}{\volt} DC power to the necessary specifications to keep the toughbook on and charged at all times, except in the event of a power outage or poor charging of the batteries in battery bank 1.
For the WR switch, a custom built DC-DC power converter takes two \SI{12}{\volt} DC inputs from battery bank 1 and converts them into a \SI{12}{\volt}, \SI{5}{\ampere} max, DC output and a \SI{24}{\volt}, \SI{2.5}{\ampere} max, DC output.
The \SI{12}{\volt} DC output is used to power the WR switch, while the \SI{24}{\volt} output line can be used to power a station DAQ either in the field or inside the CRS for debugging.
The specific ports used to power the laptop and WR switch can be controlled from an IP network switch, allowing remote power cycling of each component via the network GUI.
Two physical switches on the custom DC-DC converter can also be used to control the \SI{12}{\volt} power output, for the WR switch, and the \SI{24}{\volt} power output. 
~\Cref{fig:skala_control} shows a diagram of all connections for power, networking, communications, and data transfer inside the CRS, including the connection to individual SKALA station DAQs from the WR switch.

%The custom DC-DC converter also has physical switches to turn on and off the output voltages, and can be used to manually restart the WR switch from inside the CRS.

%The power to both systems can be controlled from a network connection or with physical switches the custom power converter inside the CRS, allowing separate power cycling of the White Rabbit switch and TAXI.

%These input signals set the master time signal of the WR switch, where power for both the GPS antenna and level shifter comes from USB-A ports of the FZ-55 toughbook.

The SKALA antennas themselves are all SKALA-v2 type antennas, shown in~\Cref{fig:skala_cad_drawing}, developed during antenna prototyping for the SKA-Low radio telescope.
SKALA antennas have two perpendicular polarizations, each with their own Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) housed in the top most part of the antenna, known as the antenna trumpet.
There are two types of LNA for SKALA-v2 antennas, a "top" LNA and a "bottom" LNA, referring to the LNA position inside the antenna trumpet with respect to its paired LNA.
Top and bottom LNAs are always paired together, one for each of the two perpendicular polarizations; however, no specific orientation for the polarization-LNA pairings are defined by default.
This must be defined and remain consistent between all antennas by the deployment team.
Once deployed, a \SI{180}{\degree} rotation of the antenna will yield the same measured radio signal in principle due to a degeneracy in the pairing of the antenna design and LNA response.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[trim={0cm 0cm 0cm 0cm},clip,width=0.7\textwidth]{chapter7/skala_antenna_cad_drawing.png}
    \caption[CAD drawing of a SKALA-v2 radio antenna.]{A CAD drawing of a SKALA-v2 radio antenna. The antenna trumpet, at the top of the antenna, houses the two LNAs. The plastic square on the body of the antenna is called the antenna spider. The spider is used during antenna assembly to fix the arms perpendicularly and remains on the antenna body after deployment for stability. The SKALA antenna ends at the bottom black leg pieces. These pieces are the antenna legs and are used to fasten the antenna to a ground structure.}
    \label{fig:skala_cad_drawing}
\end{figure}

The metal arms of the LNAs are connected directly to the metal of each antenna arm and fixed in place with screws to ensure adequate contact between the antenna and LNA.
Adequate metal contact is necessary for the LNA to properly boost the weak signal measured by the SKALA antennas.
Without good contact, the radio signal has less amplification and is more prone to signal degradation in the coaxial cables on its travel to the DAQ electronics.
The LNA pairs are interlocked in the antenna trumpet (see~\Cref{fig:lna_lab_picture}) with a plastic spacer separating them to prevent crosstalk in the electronics.
Each LNA has a gold SMA connector used to transfer the radio signal post-LNA to the DAQ electronics.
This SMA connector for the top LNA is visible in~\Cref{fig:lna_lab_picture}.
The signal from the LNA first passes through an SMA male to type-N female coaxial cable \SI{1}{\meter} in length, connected to a type-N male to type-N male coaxial cable of \SI{40}{\meter} length.
The antenna-opposite end of the \SI{40}{\meter} type-N cables connect directly to the station DAQ and are buried along the path between the antennas and DAQ to protect the cables from environmental factors, including roaming animals in the Argentinian Pampa such as cows, goats, and horses.

Three of the four metal points where the LNA to antenna contact happens are visible, along with the top LNA and its golden SMA connector. The blue tape was used by the deployment team to track the antenna orientation after placement of the protective cap. In this image, the antenna orientation is such that the polarization arms connected to the top LNA point into and out of the page, while the polarization arms for the bottom LNA point left and right.}
    \label{fig:lna_lab_picture}
\end{figure}

The DAQ for each station of three SKALA antennas is based on the DAQ developed for the Transportable Array for eXtremely large area Instrumentation studies (TAXI)~\cite{arena2014_taxi} and is hosted in a single metal container, also referred to as the TAXI housing.
The main DAQ components are handled by TAXI-v3.2, referred to solely as TAXI from now on, an updated version of the principal electronics board developed for the original project.
As power, TAXI takes \SI{24}{\volt} DC power input through a custom 5-pin connector on the TAXI housing.
The \SI{24}{\volt} power is split internally on the board into three separate voltages of \SI{3.3}{\volt}, \SI{4.5}{\volt}, and \SI{5}{\volt} using a DC-DC power converter. 
These voltages provide power to all TAXI components and all additional electronics inside the TAXI housing, where the additional electronics boards connect directly to the TAXI-v3.2 board to complete the DAQ system (see~\Cref{fig:inside_taxi}).
The first additional electronics board is the radioTad, a front-end radio electronics board to pre-process the radio signals received from the LNAs before propagating the signals forward through to the DAQ.
The LNA signals are received at a type-N female connector of the TAXI housing and then are routed to the radioTad boards hosted internal to the TAXI housing via a coaxial cable.
Each radioTad board requires \SI{4.5}{\volt} DC power, connects to a single SKALA antenna, and has two polarizations, labeled positive and negative, for the two antenna LNAs.
For simplicity, it was chosen upon deployment to have all top LNAs connect to the "positive" radioTad polarizations and all bottom LNAs to connect to the "negative" polarizations.
The radioTads power the LNAs using a bias-tee through the same coaxial cables with which they receive the LNA signals.
Once a signal reaches the radioTad from the LNA, both a high-pass and low-pass filter are applied to filter the frequency range within \SIrange{70}{350}{\mega\hertz}.
The filtered signals are converted to eight total differential signals for each LNA and fed to the TAXI board for further processing through a D-SUB 37 pin connector.
Inside the TAXI housing, the radioTads are covered with a custom made aluminum shielding to prevent bidirectional RFI leakage.

TAXI-v3.2 allows for two data taking modes to trigger the readout of the radio antennas, both controlled by the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) of TAXI.
The first mode is a "soft" trigger mode, or a software initiated trigger, to readout the radio data.
In this mode, the FPGA sends a request to read the radio data every $X$ seconds, where $X$ is the FPGA clock time passed since the previous FPGA request.
This time interval $X$ is a programmable setting for the TAXI FPGA which can be configured through the communications channel to TAXI.
The second mode is an external trigger mode.
In this case, an additional electronics board interfacing with an external detector is connected to TAXI and, upon fulfillment of a trigger condition set by the external detector electronics, sends the request to the TAXI FPGA to initiate the readout of the radio data.
The SKALA antennas for the IceCube-Gen2 prototype station and ARISE interface with different external detectors and will be described in their respective sections.
A more detailed description of the radioTad functionality and the TAXI-v3.2 processing of the radio signals is provided in~\cite{roxanneturcotte_phd2023}.

Also connected to the TAXI board is the WR-LEN board, serving as a remote access point to the WR switch in the CRS, which controls all data transfer, communications, and timing for the station DAQ.
Buried military grade optical fibers connect the WR switch to the WR-LEN boards at each SKALA station, where the WR-LEN boards connect directly to the TAXI board via a Cat7 ethernet cable to control the communications and data transfer.
The Cat7 ethernet cables provide high-speed data transfer of approximately \SI{10}{Gbps}, allowing adequate data rates to transfer all data between TAXI and the WR switch, with minimal electromagnetic interference due to the cable shielding.
Timing from the WR-LEN board is distributed to the TAXI board using two SMA cables, one to distribute the PPS signal and another for the \SI{10}{\mega\hertz} signal.
Again, these timing signals originate at the WR switch in the CRS from the GPS locked master timing signal.
\SI{5}{\volt} DC power is necessary for powering the WR-LEN board, coming directly from the TAXI internal DC-DC voltage converter.

The WR-LEN board, in the internal TAXI housing configuration, is shown in the center on the upper aluminum rack of the housing. The green Cat7 ethernet cable connects directly to the TAXI-v3.2 electronics board sitting underneath all of the additional electronics. The eight red cables connect to an additional electronics board controlling the external detector used for triggering the radio read out of the IceCube-Gen2 prototype station. This electronics board will be described in further detail in~\Cref{sec:gen2prototype}.}
    \label{fig:inside_taxi}
\end{figure}

The WR-LEN board can be housed both internal or external to the TAXI housing.
When housed externally, the WR-LEN board can remain inside its original enclosure; however, modifications to the connectors of the TAXI housing and a custom power cable must be made in order to make all connections between WR-LEN and TAXI.
The externally housed WR-LEN setup provides greater heat dissipation compared to the internal setup, as the fully upwards facing surface of the original WR-LEN enclosure acts as a heat sink. 
When housed internal to the TAXI housing, the original enclosure for the WR-LEN does not fit inside the aluminum housing and must be removed from the board.
Instead, for heat dispersion, a heat sink is placed on the main Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) chip of the WR-LEN.
A heat sink is necessary to mitigate malfunction of the WR-LEN when enclosed inside the TAXI housing.
For example, summer temperature in Malarg\"ue can reach upwards of \SI{30}{\degreeCelsius}, with further heating from the Sun.
The high temperatures, in addition to the heat generated from the other electronics inside the housing, can increase the environmental temperature conditions surrounding the WR-LEN board to near or above its upper limit for safe range of operation at \SI{50}{\degreeCelsius}.
For reference, thermal images using a FLIR infrared camera of WR-LEN boards operating outside of their original heat sink enclosure, without a heat sink on the main ASIC, and in normal lab conditions show temperature measurements of nearly \SI{100}{\degreeCelsius}.
These high temperatures also provoke further spikes and corruptions in the radio data measured by TAXI, hence the externally housed WR-LEN board is optimal for reducing these effects, yet at the expense of less dust protection.
As of now, the default for all SKALA stations is housing the WR-LEN board inside the TAXI housing.

\section{An IceCube-Gen2 Prototype Station at the Pierre Auger Observatory}\label{sec:gen2prototype}

IceCube-Gen2 is a future upgrade of the existing IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole~\cite{gen2tdr}.
The upgrade plans to increase the volume of the current in-ice optical array from \SI{1}{\kilo\meter^{3}} to approximately \SI{8}{\kilo\meter^{3}}, in addition to deploying an in-ice radio array for neutrino detection and a surface array of scintillator panels and radio antennas for cosmic-ray air shower detection.
The planned surface array will span nearly \SI{6}{\kilo\meter^{2}} to cover the full optical array extension, serving both as a veto to the optical array and to reconstruct cosmic-ray air showers and their properties~\cite{icrc2025_schroeder}.
Each station of the surface array consists of a central fieldhub hosting the station DAQ, four pairs of scintillator panels, and three SKALA radio antennas arranged in a Mercedes-Benz like three-pointed star.
The first prototype surface station was deployed at the South Pole in January 2020, with two more deployed in January 2025.
All South Pole prototypes have been mostly stable in their operations and data taking since deployment.
See~\cite{icrc2025_venugopal,icrc2025_koundal} for specifics regarding these stations.
This section discusses an IceCube-Gen2 prototype station deployed at the site of the Pierre Auger Observatory, describing the detector system and preliminary analyses performed with the station.

The purple arrow for the top LNA orientation shows which antenna arm is connected to the SMA connector side of the top LNA.

    \label{fig:gen2prototype_map}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Station Design and Deployment}\label{sec:gen2design}

In August 2022, a prototype surface station was deployed at the Pierre Auger Observatory.
~\Cref{fig:gen2prototype_map} shows the location of the prototype station adjacent to the CRS, which hosts the AERA DAQ and communications systems.
The station is co-located in both the AERA footprint and the densest part of the SD array to serve the main science goals of coincident air-shower measurements with Auger detectors and a potential cross-calibration of the AERA radio antennas and SKALA antennas of the prototype station.
The Auger prototype station has roughly the same design as the South Pole prototype stations, yet slightly different geometry and spacing due to the topology of the location (see both~\Cref{fig:gen2prototype_map,fig:gen2_dronephoto}).
Other differences include the need for fencing around each detector position to prevent damage from roaming animals, and the lack of height adjustable stands, unnecessary in Argentina as constant snow accumulation is not an issue like at the South Pole.
Each arm of the Auger prototype station spans about \SI{70}{\meter} in length, with a pair of scintillator panels at the ends of each arm and another pair of scintillator panels at the station center.
Each scintillator panel is fixed to four poles in the ground, held in place by concrete, with a mounting bracket and a semicircular cotter pin on each pole.
Halfway between the station center and the end of each arm is a SKALA-v2 radio antenna, with the orientation of each antenna polarization defined in~\Cref{fig:gen2prototype_map}.
The legs of the SKALA antennas are screwed to a rectangular baseboard fixed to the ground with concrete.
Concrete mounts for both the scintillators and SKALA antennas, shown in~\Cref{fig:gen2_deployed_hardware}, fix the detectors in place to withstand strong winds and storms in la Pampa Amarilla.
The radio LNAs are connected to TAXI from buried type-N coaxial cables as previously described.
Each coaxial cable is approximately \SI{40}{\meter} in length, with extra cable wrapped in a loop around the antenna legs.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[trim={0cm 0cm 0cm 0cm},clip,width=0.5\textwidth]{chapter7/Gen2Prototype_DronePicture.JPG}

    \label{fig:gen2_dronephoto}
\end{figure}

The scintillator panels connect to the TAXI housing from buried, custom made cables with 5-pin connectors on each end.
The signals from the panels received at the TAXI housing are fed into a custom electronics board, named microDAQ, that controls the scintillator data taking and processing.
There are eight microDAQ boards in total, one for each scintillator panel, and all are housed inside the TAXI housing.
Each connects to the TAXI electronics board and sets the external detector trigger condition for the read out of the SKALA radio antenna data.
If six of eight scintillators measure 4096 ADC counts within \SI{1}{\micro\second}, a signal is sent to TAXI to initiate the read out of the radio data.
The metal TAXI housing is stored in a weather proof aluminum box near the center of the three-pointed star to protect it from the extreme weather conditions which can occur at the field in Argentina.
The aluminum box also provides weather protection for the cables ends connecting directly to TAXI.
While weather proof, the box can not prevent overheating of the electronics housed inside, with issues such as a freezing of the microDAQs, heat related artifacts in the radio data, and thermal failure of the WR-LEN board and its connecting optical fiber.
Each heat related issue has been resolved respectively by reprogramming the microDAQs, improving the artifact removal portion of the radio data analysis pipeline, and a full replacement of the WR-LEN board and its fiber.

A naked metal wire connects the metal TAXI housing to a buried copper rod and is used for grounding the TAXI electronics.
The dirt surrounding the buried rod was salted to increase soil conductivity and provide a better grounding.
A buried military grade optical fiber of \SI{100}{\meter} length provides the connection between the WR switch inside the CRS and the WR-LEN board inside the TAXI housing for the station.
This fiber connection handles all data transfer, communications, and timing for the prototype station.
Currently, the open \SI{24}{\volt} DC power line from the custom DC-DC converter in the CRS is used to power the IceCube-Gen2 prototype station from a buried \SI{100}{\meter} length 5-pin power cable with lightning protection.
However, in the coming months, TAXI will be placed on a solar power system, removing the need for this power cable and freeing the \SI{24}{\volt} DC power line in the CRS for debugging other TAXIs during fieldwork.

\section{ARISE: Auger Radio Infill SKALA Extension}\label{sec:arise}

The Auger Radio Infill SKALA Extension (ARISE) was deployed in March of 2025, centered upon SD tank Lety Jr. of the \SI{433}{\meter} spaced array of the Auger SD.
ARISE consists of six stations, with their centers organized in a hexagonal pattern surrounding Lety Jr., as seen in~\Cref{fig:arise_map}.
The station centers are located approximately \SI{80}{\meter} from Lety Jr., each consisting of three SKALA-v2 antennas arranged in a Mercedes-Benz like star pattern with each antenna \SI{40}{\meter} from the station center. 
One arm of each station is aligned such that an antenna is halfway between Lety Jr. and each station center.
The final positions of the 18 SKALA-v2 antennas were optimized through a simulation study to maximize the number of vertical air showers above the threshold for full reconstruction efficiency.
For this array of 18 SKALA antennas, a larger overall footprint will observe more air showers, but will increase the energy threshold for full efficiency due to the increased spacing between antennas. 
With the described antenna positions, full reconstruction efficiency ($>$ 97\%) is reached at \SI{300}{\peta\electronvolt} for near-vertical air showers ($\theta <$ \SI{30}{\degree}), resulting in reconstruction statistics of $\simeq$\,45 air showers per year~\cite{uhecr2024_verpoest}.
Current machine learning based radio denoising and reconstruction algorithms can lower this energy threshold by a factor of two once implemented in the data pipeline, increasing the statistics of reconstructed air showers~\cite{abdulrehman_phd2024}.
Radio reconstructions of near-vertical air showers at Auger now, for the first time, have full reconstruction efficiency above \SI{300}{\peta\electronvolt} within the footprint of ARISE.

%ARISE is the first radio array of its kind for air shower detection at Auger with a studied threshold for full efficiency.

%The science potential of ARISE is manifold. In addition to fully efficient air-shower reconstructions, the co-location of ARISE within the UMD and AERA footprints of Auger 
%Combining ARISE radio detection with UMD measurements provide a direct way to simultaneously reconstruct $X_{\rm max}$ and $N_{\mu}$ for the same air showers, as previous analyses with SKALA-v2 antennas have proven their reconstruction potential for $X_{\rm max}$~\cite{icrc2023_turcotte}.

ARISE can then serve as a pathfinder array for this hybrid detection method, making progress towards major science goals of next-generation air-shower arrays in the quest for constraining high-energy hadronic interaction models, improved mass composition measurements, and potentially solving the muon puzzle.
Furthermore, the co-location with AERA allows a potential cross-calibration to be performed between the AERA and SKALA radio energy scales.
However, it remains to be seen how this cross-calibration will be performed, as the location of ARISE is in the currently decommissioned portion of the AERA footprint.
Given the currently foreseen runtime of Auger until 2035, approximately 500 air showers will be reconstructed with ARISE, providing a large dataset of air showers for high-quality analyses with intermittent results in the coming years.

TAXI is housed inside a weather proof box at the local station center.
Communications to TAXI are performed via buried optical fiber cables from the station centers to the White Rabbit switch in the CRS, in the same way as the IceCube-Gen2 prototype station. 
The readout of the radio data is triggered by the local station T1 trigger of the Auger SD tank Lety Jr (see~\Cref{sec:sd} for an explanation of Auger SD triggers).
The software-level T1 trigger is routed through a \SI{50}{\ohm} terminated SMA cable from the \texttt{TRIGGEROUT} port of the Auger UUB to a custom-made trigger splitter housed inside the electronics dome of Lety Jr.
The custom designed aluminum box splits the electrical signal from the \texttt{TRIGGEROUT} connector six ways, each feeding into an optical Tx, digital-to-optical signal converter, board.
Six \SI{100}{\meter} military grade optical fibers are trenched from Lety Jr. to each of the six ARISE station centers, connecting the optical Tx boards to an optical Rx board inside the TAXI enclosure.
The optical Rx board reconverts the signal from optical back to digital for TAXI to initiate the readout of the radio signal by each of the station's three SKALA antennas.
In principle, the optical trigger signals should arrive at each TAXI simultaneously; however, nanosecond to sub-nanosecond time differences could occur due to the conversion and reconversion process (Check actual value!!).

Each of the TAXIs is autonomously powered from a solar power system at the station center.
The solar power system consists of six batteries, a solar panel, and a charge controller to control the charging of the batteries and regulate the voltage supplied to TAXI.
Six \SI{12}{\volt} batteries are used per station, connected in a three series two parallel configuration to provide the \SI{24}{\volt} necessary to power TAXI.
The batteries are also stored in the station center at the bottom of the wooden box and separated from the TAXI and charge controller via a wooden plank separator.
Station centers are equipped with a dual-sided solar panel of type LX-440M108GG WM1 to charge the batteries during good weather.
Solar panels are aligned with the broad, open-facing side perpendicular with compass North to maximize the amount of sunlight impacting the solar cells of the panels.

Connected in series between the charge controller and TAXI inside the station center is the ARISE Control and Housekeeping (CHK) box.
The CHK box serves two purposes: 1. to allow remote power cycling of the TAXI, and 2. records the voltage and current supplied to TAXI.
The heart of the CHK box is a BeagleBone Black (BBB) single-board debian computer which handles all operations using python and bash scripts to remotely turn on/off TAXI and control the power logging service.
Connection to BBB is set from a Ubiquiti LiteBeam antenna that connects to a Ubiquiti Rocket housed at the CRS.
The \SI{24}{\volt} powering TAXI is used to also power the LiteBeam antenna from a power over ethernet (PoE) converter.


%Once connected to BBB, shell scripts can be executed to remotely turn on/off TAXI and start the power logging service.
%All functions of the CHK box are handled by a BeagleBone Black single-board linux computer.

Communications, data transfer, and timing of the TAXIs are all provided by buried military grade optical fibers trenched from the CRS to Lety Jr., and then to each ARISE station center along each arm of the array.
This protocol and setup is the same as for the IceCube-Gen2 prototype station, except for in one of the ARISE stations where the WR-LEN board is housed outside of the TAXI housing itself and inside its original enclosure.
The externally housed WR-LEN will reduce heat inside the TAXI housing as the original WR-LEN enclosure contains a heat sink over its full surface, allowing the heat to dissipate more efficiently in this configuration rather than within the TAXI housing and only with a small heat sink attached to the hottest FPGA chip of the WR-LEN.
The WR-LEN temperatures can exceed \SI{80}{\degreeCelsius} in the field at Argentina because of the warm weather environment and heating from the Sun, therefore reducing the heat inside the TAXI enclosure is a safer environment for the electronics.
%The original WR-LEN enclosure contains a heat sink over its full surface

The T1 trigger that controls the readout of the radio signal at each station arrives at TAXI from Lety Jr. at an average rate of \SI{100}{\hertz}.
Each radio binary file has a storage size of approximately \SI{100}{\mega\byte} resulting in a daily data volume of \SI{2}{\tera\byte} from ARISE; yet, in the current setup, data storage is limited between two \SI{8}{\tera\byte} SSDs connected to the FZ-55 toughbook in the CRS.
The T1 level trigger contains mostly low-energy air showers to be used for calibrating the PMTs.
Therefore applying a match of the T1 timestamps at TAXI with the first physics level trigger (T3) timestamps of events in which Lety Jr. participates results in a lowering of the rate to $\mathcal{O}$(\SI{0.01}{\hertz}).
Matching of events is done locally at the toughbook laptop in the CRS by a daily transfer of the Auger iklog files to the laptop and then matching by timestamp with each radio binary.
Once matched the files are then transferred to a storage computer at the Karlsruhe Institute for Technology, and then further transferred to a data storage computer at the University of Delaware.

The T1 trigger rate averages to \SI{100}{\hertz}, yet is a Poissonian process.
Therefore, at any given moment the rate can reach values $>$\SI{500}{\hertz} that introduce an artificial dead time in the radio data readout due to a buffer pileup at TAXI.
Currently, this results in a dead time of approximately 50\% in the radio data taking.
Firmware updates for TAXI are being developed that will improve TAXI's handling of large data rates and in hand decrease the length of data taking dead time.

%Currently, the large trigger rate of \SI{100}{\hertz} that reaches each TAXI introduces an artificial dead time in the radio data readout due to a buffer pileup.
