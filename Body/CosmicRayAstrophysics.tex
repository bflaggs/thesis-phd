\chapter{Cosmic Ray Astrophysics}\label{chap:cosmicrays}
For centuries, physicists and the like have studied radiation, charges, and similar phenomena.
However, radiation was always assumed to be from the ground.
Until XXXX when SOME GUY proposed the idea that radiation could come from space.


The first instrument used to study these processes was the electroscope, a simple device used to detect the presence of charge.


designed to detect the presence of charge was the electroscope.

Studies were conducted using electroscopes, the first instrument designed to detect the presence of charge, to prove various properties of radiation and radiactive materials.
Marie and Pierre Curie 
Yet, over 100 years ago, some physicsits had the idea that 

The Universe is beaming with astrophyscal processes occurring at various energy scales.
At each energy scale, the physical processes occurring at these astrophysical objects produce charged particles, referred to as cosmic rays.
Yet, 




Cosmic rays span over ten orders of magnitude in energy, with the highest energy cosmic rays exceeding the center of mass energy of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) collisions by several orders of magnitude.
